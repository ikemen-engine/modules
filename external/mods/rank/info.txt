This external module offers common solution for Rank mechanics, often found in
commercial games.

================================================================================
Installation

1. Extract archive content into "./external/mods/rank" directory
2. Add DEF code, sprites and sounds to your screenpack system.def, system.sff,
   system.snd files. By default this module comes with resources that work only
   for 720p localcoord screenpacks (e.g. mugen1 motif shipped withe engine)
   Skip this step if motif of your choice comes with rank resources built-in.

General info

The core of this system, coded in rank.zss, has been adopted from add004
mechanics designed by Shiyo Kakuge.

Different types of rank points (by default belonging to tech, guard, attack,
life groups) can be displayed alongside overall grade as individual gauges
showcasing ratio of points gathered in those groups. Rank screen can also
display icons and score points collected during match (score points are
independent from rank points).

Your overall performance during match is graded at the end of each round
(roundstate = 4) with one of 14 different rank grades (by default, customizable
via rank.lua), calculated as follows:

Grade = RankScore / 8

RankScore is a sum of rank points gathered in different rank groups. Result
value is floored and the corresponding grade art is displayed (as specified
under screenpack [Rank Info] section). If you need to adjust this formula or
other aspects of rank rendering that can't be changed by editing screenpack
parameters, check out functions present in rank.lua file.

Rank screen look can be defined via screenpack [Rank Info] section. If this
screenpack group is missing, rank grade won't be displayed at all (enabled
parameter defaults to 0).
